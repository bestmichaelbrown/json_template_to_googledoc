# json_template_to_googledoc
A bash script to fill a predefined google document template with a json-formatted parameter file.

Originally, the Google scripting API was used to parse a JSON file, but an unknown problem arose and it stopped working. This was a fix developed that hopefully will provide a lot of use.
